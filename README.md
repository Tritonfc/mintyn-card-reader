# Mintyn Card Reader

This project mimics a card reader application designed to extract card information from any type of credit/debit card using either input text by the user or Scanning the card powered by Google's MLkit library and CameraX

## Repo

- I used a starter template which automatically comes with basic dependencies in a config file to speed up dev process. So there would be lots of unused library dependencies. The starter template can be found here: https://github.com/dhavalshah05/starter_android
- The project follows clean architecture practices with MVVM.
- Retrofit is used for API calls, CameraX for Scanning and MLKIT for text Recognition.
- Unit tests have been included.
